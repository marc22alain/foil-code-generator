BUGS:
- irregular chines
- irregular angles
- cuts at x_right when at the right end of the stock
- scaling issues in the g-code !!!
	- due to a __design flaw__

DESIGN FLAWS:
- inconsistent and confusing use of metric/imperial units
- integration with other g-code generation
- consideration of the rest of the stock and foil geometry

MISSING FEATURES:
- foil truncation
- template cut
- fine profile cut

***separation of concerns
	-pass out when to move to new x-coord and where
	-pass out to what depths to move
