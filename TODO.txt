BUGS:
- irregular chines
- irregular angles
	.seems prevalent for the first chine ... check out what happens at radians tolerance = 1.000, no chine length improves the first chine
	.fixing this would probably address the one above

DESIGN FLAWS:
- integration with other g-code generation
- consideration of the rest of the stock and foil geometry
	.for transitions especially
- not properly cutting both sides of the board in one programming prep
	.the mirrored (second?) cut uses the same stock thickness and not the thickness left after the first cut

MISSING FEATURES:
- foil truncation
- template cut
- fine profile cut

EXTENSIONS:
- other foil profiles
	.such as NACA 63- series
- view and more for planning transitions
	.transitions cutting
- view and more for planning skew
- view and more for planning taper in all dimensions
	.foil tapering in x and y dimensions

SUITABILITY for SHARING:
- requiring good documentation
	.Github is one place
	.marcotypes is another... or at least providing a link to Github

MISCELLANEOUS notes:
- max-chine length should be influenced by the bit... no point in making the chines longer than the bit radius
